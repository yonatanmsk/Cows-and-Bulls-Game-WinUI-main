Garage simulator - OOP

This project is one of the tasks required in the course "Object Oriented Programming in C# and the .NET Framework". The main propuse of this task was to test the way we plan classes architecture and using polymorphism. In the docx file "Classes - Explanation & architecture", you can see how we designed the project and you can read a brief explanation of each calss we created.

We had to design a garage database that can get each of the following vehicles types: electric/fuel car, electric/fuel motorcycle, fuel track. Each type of vehicle has special attributes like fuel type, number of doors (for car only), etc. In addition, the user can perform different operations on the vehicles currently in the garage.

The code was written in such way that in order to add a new vehicle tpye in the future, this can be done by minimal change in the code.
